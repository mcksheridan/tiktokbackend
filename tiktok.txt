TikTok User Stories / Requirements



Phase 1:

As a registered user, I want to be able to enter URLs for TikTok videos and save these into a default “master” bookmark list.

As a registered user, I want to be able to permanently delete saved videos that I don’t like from the master list.

As a registered user, I do not want to see duplicate videos in my bookmark folders or my master list.

As a desktop user, I want to be able to view my saved TikToks in the same browser window.

As a mobile user, I want to be redirected to the TikTok application (or to the TikTok website) to view videos.

As a registered user, I want to be able to search my master list using tags and/or video descriptions that TikTok content creators have added.

As a user, if a video that I saved is no longer available on TikTok, I should be able to see name of the content creator and the description for the video.




Phase 2:

As a registered user, I want to be able to create, rename, and delete bookmark folders. I want to be able to add videos to these folders from my master list. I still want these videos to appear in my master list. I want to be able to add videos directly to a bookmark folder and have the video appear in the master list as well.

As a registered user, I want to be able to change the order of videos in a bookmark folder.

As a registered user, I want to be able to add multiple videos to one bookmark folder simultaneously.

As a registered user, I want to be able to delete video from a bookmark folder without deleting it from the master list of videos.




Phase 3: 

As a website visitors, I want to be able to log in to or register an account to save my videos and bookmark folders.

As a registered user, I want to be able to share a bookmark list with a friend who does not have an account.




Phase 4:
