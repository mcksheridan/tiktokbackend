# TikTok Bookmark Organizer Application

## Purpose
This app will allow users to import videos (either in the form of a URL or an entire list of videos exported directly from their TikTok data) and organize videos in bookmark lists they create. Users will also be able to sort data using information available from the [official TikTok API](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/Embed) as well as the date added as a bookmark and the date added to TikTok.

## Technologies
Currently, I'm using ExpressJS/Node, Sass, Pug, PostgreSQL, and Passport.js for user authentication.
I started this project before I knew anything about the backend. It's very messy, has a lot of repetitive code and a lot of technical debt, and really needs to be refactored. When working on my local computer, the app is mostly functional but there are still multiple issues with network requests, asynchronous code, form validation, and error handling, among others.
If there is time available to improve the UI, I would also like to make the code more responsive.
I recently tried to separate some of the repetitive nature of the app into a [separate API](https://github.com/mcksheridan/tiktok-video-info)that incorporated data from the official API, but the other API is also not functioning consisently. (For example, [this request](https://tiktok-video-info.herokuapp.com/?url=https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeSmtLQF) should return information about a salmon cooking video, as should [this additional request](https://tiktok-video-info.herokuapp.com/?url=https://m.tiktok.com/v/6940464478895033605.html?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgow5cC5NQT8uhxg5k0kIYRLkbhPgZeFY729aqfKhdNw8QBapuTeAkwxQI5EdXuW6XDJGgA%3D&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAcpWX0w_R0HRDtAEcOyWjFaNih6VZ32m18Q-FZXbg0dbuTDFjbw7Apz-rSMCDqOBq&share_item_id=6940464478895033605&share_link_id=5E1DAA26-82DE-43D6-9D54-D3B16F687ECE&timestamp=1616100615&tt_from=copy&u_code=dbee5f8gf8bk3e&user_id=6807463091828278277&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=copy), and [this other request](https://tiktok-video-info.herokuapp.com/?url=https://www.tiktok.com/@cricketscorner/video/6940464478895033605?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgow5cC5NQT8uhxg5k0kIYRLkbhPgZeFY729aqfKhdNw8QBapuTeAkwxQI5EdXuW6XDJGgA%3D&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAcpWX0w_R0HRDtAEcOyWjFaNih6VZ32m18Q-FZXbg0dbuTDFjbw7Apz-rSMCDqOBq&share_item_id=6940464478895033605&share_link_id=5E1DAA26-82DE-43D6-9D54-D3B16F687ECE&timestamp=1616100615&tt_from=copy&u_code=dbee5f8gf8bk3e&user_id=6807463091828278277&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=copy&source=h5_m), but there's a good chance none of those requests will work...)
